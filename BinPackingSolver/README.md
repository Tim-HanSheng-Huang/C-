## Bin Packing Problem Solver

### Description: 
Solve bin packing problems (BPP) by the first-fit algorithm (FF) and genetic algorithm(GA).   

### Bin Packing Problem: 
Given a finite set O of numbers (the object sizes), and two constants B (the bin size) and N (the number of bins), is it possible to “pack” all the objects into N bins.  
(Does there exist a partition of O into N or less subsets, such that the sum of elements in any of the subsets doesn't exceed B)

### Using Steps:
1. Download the "[testing files (.sop)](https://github.com/Tim-HanSheng-Huang/C_Sharp/tree/main/GeneticAlgorithm/TestingProblemFiles)"
and "[execution file (.exe)](https://github.com/Tim-HanSheng-Huang/C_Sharp/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/GA_Solver_JobAssignment.exe)".
2. Open the .exe file and click an encoding method.

3. Click the "Reset" button and adjust the parameters of GA, such as crossover rate, or mutation rate.

4. Click the "Run One Iteration" button to see the outcome after one iteration or click "Run to End" button to see the final outcome.
