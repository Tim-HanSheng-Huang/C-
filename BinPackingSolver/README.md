## Bin Packing Problem Solver

### Description: 
Solve bin packing problems (BPP) by the first-fit algorithm (FF) and grouping genetic algorithm(GGA).   

### Bin Packing Problem: 
Given a finite set O of numbers (the object sizes), and two constants B (the bin size) and N (the number of bins), is it possible to “pack” all the objects into N bins.  
(Does there exist a partition of O into N or less subsets, such that the sum of elements in any of the subsets doesn't exceed B)

### Using Steps:
1. Download the "[testing files (.txt)](https://github.com/Tim-HanSheng-Huang/C_Sharp/tree/main/BinPackingSolver/TestingFiles)"
and "[execution file (.exe)](https://github.com/Tim-HanSheng-Huang/C_Sharp/blob/main/BinPackingSolver/R09725060HSHunagBinPacking.exe)".

2. Open the .exe file and click file and open button at the top left corner to import the testing files.

3. After importing testing files, select the "First Fit Solver" tab.

4. Click the "Solve by First Fit Method" button to see the outcome generated by FF solver.

5. Select the "GGA Solver" tab, and click the "Reset" button and adjust the parameters of GA, such as crossover rate, or mutation rate. Then, click the "Run One Iteration" button to see the outcome after one iteration or click "Run to End" button to see the final outcome.
