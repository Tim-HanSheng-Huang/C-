## Genetic Algorithm Solver For Job Assignment Problem

### Description: 
Solve the job assignment problems by the binary-encoded and permutation-encoded genetic algorithm.   
### Job Assignment Problem: 
Supposed there are n machines and n jobs to be processed. Each machine must be assigned with exactly one job. The time required to set up each machine for processingeach job is different and given in a time matrix C. The objective is to minimize the total setup time needed to complete the jobs. 
### Using Steps:
1. Download the "[testing files (.sop)](https://github.com/Tim-HanSheng-Huang/C_Sharp/tree/main/GeneticAlgorithm/TestingProblemFiles)"
and "[execution file (.exe)](https://github.com/Tim-HanSheng-Huang/C_Sharp/blob/main/GeneticAlgorithm/GA_Solver_JobAssignment.exe)".
2. Open the .exe file and click an encoding method.

3. Click the "Reset" button and adjust the parameters of GA, such as crossover rate, or mutation rate.
